# SQLAlchemy-Challenge

Notes:
- Output for precipation do not match images, but the descriptive statistics total 2,000 + items, which doesn't make sense if the data is grouped by date to come up with an average daily rainfall
- Try eliminating the group by date and just have it plot the data by day


Log
8/23:
- Inputing initial analysis into Flask API

8/22:
- Solved base Precipitation and Station analyses
- Majority of time spent familiarizing myself with reflection and session commands of SQLAlchemy.  Relatively straightforward once overcoming the initial hurdle of database reflection.
